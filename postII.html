                            <h4>Referral Hiring and its Impact on Gender Imbalance</h4>
                            <p>This data shows that the way many companies hire new staff is highly relied on networking and
                              referral. Networking and internal hiring is popular for many companies including tech companies
                              because their advantages are very clear. Firstly and most importantly, referral is cheaper compared
                              to spending money on job advertising. Secondly, HR managers can find potential applicants that
                              they know about very efficiently. Because compared to reading tons of resumes and cover letters,
                              directly talking to someone who they may already know is much more time and energy saving. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>However, the disadvantages of the referral and networking hiring methods are also very obvious.
                              One of the biggest disadvantages would be the biases of HR managers when making hiring decisions.
                              In a male dominated industry, like the tech industry, referral hiring method could further cease the
                              gender imbalance within the organizations. As <a target="_blank"
                              href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/how-to-use-employee-referrals-without-giving-up-workplace-diversity"><u>Frank</u></a>
                              has pointed out, white women and women of color
                              are, respectively, 12 percent and 35 percent less likely to get referrals when looking for jobs compared to white male
                              in the United States. Further more, when compared to other industries, 58 percent of organizations within the tech
                              industry utilize the referral bonuses. This has lead to unfair treatment for women when
                              competing with men in the labour market. Therefore, we encourage organizations and companies in the
                              tech industry to take action to reduce hiring practices that will cause direct or indirect discrimination
                              during the hiring process. Listed below are some specific actions recruiting managers should consider to help create a more
                              diverse and inclusive work environment:</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li><b>Create a more transparent and accurate hiring process.</b> Sometimes, biases can be very hard to
                                notice. Therefore, it is essential for companies to make the hiring process more transparent and accurate
                                to reduce the mistakes made by subjective judgements. Companies may also consider creating a monitor
                                system to further control the whole hiring process. Captain mentioned that <a target="_blank"
                                href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/how-to-use-employee-referrals-without-giving-up-workplace-diversity"><u>tech companies</u></a> need to pay
                                attention to their subtle biases in the hiring emails which could cause antipathy from women candidates.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b>Analyze the referral hiring percentage of all the hiring methods.</b> If your company uses referral
                                as a major source of hiring new employees, then it is time for you to discover more diverse ways of hiring.
                                Hiring from external sources will provide you talents with new ideas which could be very beneficial for the
                                long-term development. Frank also suggested that companies need to gather demographic data of their
                                employees to see which specific hiring source is causing the gender imbalance.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b>Encourage diverse referral.</b> Referral hiring can even help your company acquire a more diverse
                                workforce if you use it right. For example, <a target="_blank"
                                href="https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/08/03/intel-doubles-up-on-hiring-women-and-minorities/"</a><u>Zakrzewski</u></a>
                                reported that Intel is encouraging its employees
                                to refer women and minorities by giving doubled referral bonuses. </li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Sarah's Story</h4>
                            <p>Sarah has received numerous emails from tech recruiters. Despite these emails making her feel noticed, she does not feel valued.
                              The content of the emails makes it seem as if she is being contacted for her gender, instead of her talent.
                              Unfortunately, many companies make this mistake during the recruiting process. In order to not put off great candidates like Sarah, companies
                              need to realize the importance of treating all candidates with equal respect when trying to increase workforce diversity. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Referral hiring is one of the main reasons that causes gender imbalance in the tech
                              industry. However, if companies can take appropriate actions to diversify its hiring methods, gender equality would be
                              achievable in the near future. </p>
