                              have shown that employee engagement is critical in an organization and is the
                              driver behind innovation and operational success. It is a wonder as to why
                              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2016/people-organization-leadership-talent-rewards-engaged-female-workforce.aspx#chapter2"><u>senior women are disproportionately
                              negatively influenced by disengagement</u></a>. In other words, when an organization is
                              more engaged as a whole, women in senior positions are more engaged then men in senior positions, whereas the
                              engagement are about equal when the organization is less engaged.</p>

                              which shows this relationship, evaluated through a question each asked to both men
                              and women in nonmanager, manager and senior manager positions. Each has a higher engagement score for women
                              in nonmanager role, similar for manager, and higher from men in senior manager role.</p>

                            <p>It is also noted that <a target="_blank"
                              href="https://www.inhersight.com/blog/data-research/how-men-perceive-support-for-women?_n=74246141#"><u>men don’t
                                accurately assess women’s satisfaction</u></a>, so if a board of male directors are making decisions
                                on how to improve engagement, they may not have the best judgement. From this, WorkBC follows
                                BCG’s suggestion on listening to senior women. Every organization is struggling due to different
                                problems, so implementing the same solution would not solve each organization’s problems. Each
                                organization needs to consider what are their root causes for disengagement.</p>

                              <u>three common solutions</u></a> that BCG has provided which will improve not only women’s engagement,
                              but the entire organization’s engagement.</p>
                            <br>
                            <ol>
                              <li><b>Rewrite the Rules</b>, rethinking communication for feedback, providing flexible work models
                                and reducing gender-based pay gap. Both men and women benefit from stronger
                                feedback where it is grounded and provided actual direction for improvement of both strengths
                                and weaknesses. It also allows for promotion and compensation to be linked directly to performance
                                with justification for any differences between different employees. For employees to perform well in
                                the long run, flexible work models should be available to not only new mothers, but to everyone. This
                                would allow the employees to support their family in times of need.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b>Support Peer-to-Peer Connections</b>, with connections among peers and shared goals, everyone
                                would benefit more from another person’s success. The focus is on teamwork and providing great support
                                to their peers. A suggested implementation is reducing the weight to failures if employees sought help
                                to the right people. WorkBC supports the promotion of individuals who demonstrate teamwork rather than individual heroes. </li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b>Hold Leaders Accountable for Results</b>, allowing leaders to understand organization values and implement them not
                                only in dealing with clients but also employees. Leaders should have the flexibility to use their unique skills
                                to better the organization. This also includes having the KPI metrics for not only employees themselves, but also
                                being responsible for a set amount of promotions and compensation rewards.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            <p>Sarah may only be an imaginary character, but she represents the thousands of women who are entering the workforce for the first time.
                              She also represents the girls who were inspired by technology but were deheartened by an endless list of hardships.
                              For Sarah to achieve her career and personal life aspirations, every step
                              from education to hiring to career development are necessary. No matter how
                              talented she may be, she still needs to be given these opportunities to learn
                              and shine in the organization. Only this way, could she become a longterm asset of her organization.</p>
