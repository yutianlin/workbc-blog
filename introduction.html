                            <p>One of the most prevalent problems we face in the technology industry is the lack of gender diversity.
                              There has been a historical underrepresentation of women across most technology companies in the
                              world, but why is this now being treated as a significant problem by technology giants like Google,
                              Amazon, and Microsoft? Why is gender diversity beneficial to a company, or the lack of gender diversity
                              considered a loss?</p>
                            <p>There are both quantitative and qualitative evidence which suggest that gender diversity is imperative
                              to a modern company’s success. We will use three facets to define success: financial performance,
                              company reputation, and talent pool.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Per this report by McKinsey, companies with better diversity tend to have better financial performance overall.
                              Specifically, companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent more likely to have financial
                              returns above their national industry medians. For example, in the United Kingdom, for every 10 percent increase
                              in gender diversity, earnings before interest and taxes rose by 3.5 percent. In a Financial Times article, it was
                              cited that companies with more women on their boards have delivered a 46 percent better return on equity since 2010,
                              in comparison to groups which lack this gender diversity. Thus, in addition in increasing overall gender diversity
                              within a company, it would also be beneficial to increase women representation on senior-executive teams.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In a 2018 survey by Atlassian, 77 percent of respondents think diversity and inclusion are important to
                              their company, 85 percent think that diversity and inclusion are important to employees are their company.
                              From this, we can see the implications that gender diversity may have on a company’s image to both the
                              public and their own employees. People care about diversity, and think it’s important. With the current
                              buzz on gender diversity, companies performing better in this aspect are portrayed as more progressive and
                              innovative than companies who are doing worse. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The notion of company reputation or public image leads us into our next issue of skill shortages. Around
                              40 percent of companies are facing skill shortages, as competitors draw on the same talent pool as everyone
                              else. A simple solution would be to recruit from non-traditional sources, such as minority groups and
                              associations in tech, for example, local Women in Tech groups. The untapped labour markets will give a
                              company access to talent with more diverse perspectives, and a diverse group of workers is more likely
                              to do a better job than a homogeneous group. A positive side effect of a more diverse workforce is better
                              engagement, which boosts a company’s private and public image.</p>

                            <p>In the next few blogs to come, we will follow the footsteps of a woman named Sarah. We will explore the
                              obstacles she will face, and how she should overcome them to achieve her career goals in the tech industry.</p>
