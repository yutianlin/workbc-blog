                            <p>One of the most prevalent problems we face in the technology industry is the lack of gender diversity.
                              There has been a historical underrepresentation of women across most technology companies in the world,
                              but why is this now being treated as a significant problem by technology giants like Google, Amazon, and
                              Microsoft? Why is gender diversity beneficial to a company, or the lack of gender diversity considered a loss?</p>
                              <br>
                            <p>There are both quantitative and qualitative evidence which suggest that gender diversity is imperative
                              to a modern company’s success. We will use three facets to define success: <b>financial performance</b>, <b>company
                              reputation</b>, and <b>talent pool</b>.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Diversity leads to better financial performance</h4>
                            <p>Per <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters"><u>this</u></a>
                               report by McKinsey, companies with better diversity tend to have better financial performance overall. Specifically,
                               companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their
                               national industry medians. For example, in the United Kingdom, for every 10 percent increase in gender diversity,
                               earnings before interest and taxes rose by 3.5 percent. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In a Financial Times <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/7325af98-9a9d-11e5-a5c1-ca5db4add713"><u>article</u></a>,
                              it was cited that companies with more women on their boards have delivered a
                              46 percent better return on equity since 2010, in comparison to groups which lack this gender diversity. Thus,
                              in addition in increasing overall gender diversity within a company, it would also be beneficial to increase
                              women representation on senior-executive teams.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Diversity enhances company reputation</h4>
                            <p>In a 2018 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/diversity/survey/2018"><u>survey</u></a> by Atlassian, 77
                              percent of respondents think diversity and inclusion are important to their company, 85 percent think that diversity
                              and inclusion are important to employees are their company. From this, we can see the implications that gender diversity
                              may have on a company’s image to both the public and their own employees. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>People care about diversity, and think it’s important. With the current buzz on gender diversity, companies performing
                              better in this aspect are portrayed as more progressive and innovative than companies who are doing worse. </p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Diversity hiring opens untapped talent pools</h4>
                            <p>The notion of company reputation or public image leads us into our next issue of skill shortages. Around
                              <a target="_blank" href="https://devskiller.com/diversity-in-tech/"><u>40 percent of companies</u></a> are facing skill
                              shortages, as competitors draw on the same talent pool as everyone else. A simple solution would be to recruit
                              from non-traditional sources, such as minority groups and associations in tech, for example, local Women in Tech groups. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The untapped labour markets will give a company access to talent with more diverse perspectives, and a diverse
                              group of workers is <a target="_blank" href="https://devskiller.com/diversity-in-tech/"><u>more likely to do a better job</u></a>
                              than a homogeneous group. A positive side effect of a more diverse workforce is better engagement, which boosts a
                              company’s private and public image.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In the next few blogs to come, we will follow the footsteps of a woman named Sarah. We will explore the obstacles
                              she will face, and how she should overcome them to achieve her career goals in the tech industry.</p>
